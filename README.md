## Working Locally
- Saves time so that you don't have to rewrite code to replicate a change you already mad ein the past
- Useful for keeping track of old versions of your project
- Can try out different techniques by starting a new branch
- If you mess up you can retrace your steps until you get to a version that worked properly
- Can add notes to each change you make with -m command
## Working with Remotes
- Able to collaborate as a team on a project
- You can do anyhting you want locally and it will not affect the remote file 
- If you are wondering what progress others have made, you can pull to see what they've committed to the remote repository
- Makes for a more efficient development team because there wont be two people working on the same task
- In the case of GitHub, a remote repository comes with a neat and tidy UI
